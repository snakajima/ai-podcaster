      "text": "So, what’s happening now with net neutrality? Well, just recently, attorneys representing the FCC and various groups in the broadband industry presented their arguments to a panel of judges from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. This was more than just a routine court appearance. It’s part of an endless legal back-and-forth over whether internet service providers, or ISPs, should be classified as 'common carriers' under Title II regulations. This classification would prevent ISPs from selectively slowing down or throttling certain types of web traffic.",

But then, under President Trump, these rules were repealed, only to be reinstated under President Biden's FCC this past April. But, just as quickly as these rules were put back in place, they were put on hold by the Sixth Circuit Court while this current case unfolds.",

      "text": "During the recent hearing, the judges questioned the arguments from both sides. It was clear that the crux of the debate revolves around the FCC’s authority to enforce these rules, especially after two Supreme Court rulings that have limited the powers of federal regulatory agencies. Specifically, these cases have brought more attention to the 'major questions' doctrine, which basically says that Congress must clearly authorize agencies to make significant policy decisions. In addition, there’s the end of something called Chevron deference — a doctrine that previously directed judges to defer to agency expertise when laws were ambiguous.",

      "text": "Now, without Chevron deference, the courts have more leeway to interpret whether policies like net neutrality should be enforced. This makes it harder for the FCC to implement and enforce these rules, which is exactly what the broadband industry is arguing. Jeffrey Wall, representing the industry, described the FCC’s actions as a potential power grab, arguing that if allowed, the FCC might start to control a range of ISP activities — from the types of plans they offer to the costs.",

And the timing here is interesting — depending on who wins the upcoming presidential election, the future of net neutrality could shift yet again. Remember, it was a change in administration that led to the repeal of net neutrality under Trump’s FCC, and the reinstatement under Biden’s FCC.",
