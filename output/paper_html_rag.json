      "text": "Today, we’re delving into a fascinating topic in the world of AI and natural language processing: how a new approach called HtmlRAG is enhancing knowledge retrieval in AI systems by keeping data in its original HTML format. This idea comes from a recent research paper titled 'HtmlRAG: HTML is Better Than Plain Text for Modeling Retrieved Knowledge in RAG Systems,' which explores why HTML can be more effective than plain text in providing context to large language models. This work is available on arXiv, and you can find it at arxiv.org under the code 2411.02959.",

      "text": "So, why is this research important? Well, as large language models like ChatGPT and others become more widely used, they face challenges in keeping information accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to user questions. Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a process where these models use external sources like the Web to answer questions more accurately and reduce the chances of 'hallucinating' or generating incorrect information. Typically, RAG systems retrieve data from the web, strip it down to plain text, and then feed that to the model. But much of the valuable structure and meaning within the original HTML, like headings, tables, or even code, gets lost in this process.",

      "text": "HtmlRAG introduces a solution: instead of converting everything to plain text, it keeps information in its HTML format, allowing the AI to retain more structural context and relational meaning. This is especially useful for complex data that has inherent formatting, like tables or lists. For example, imagine retrieving data from a web page that has an organized table. If you convert this to plain text, you lose the table structure, and the information could become confusing or misleading.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "But using HTML as input also has its own set of challenges. HTML files include lots of extra content—tags, JavaScript, CSS—that’s not relevant to the answer and just adds noise. The HtmlRAG team addresses this with a two-part approach: first, they 'clean' the HTML, removing unnecessary parts like JavaScript and CSS styles; then, they apply a 'pruning' technique to keep only the relevant HTML sections, preserving as much meaningful structure as possible without overwhelming the model with too much data.",

      "duration": 31.812
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "The pruning process itself is intriguing. They use something called a 'block tree,' where the HTML is organized into hierarchical sections or 'blocks' that represent meaningful parts of the web page. The model then evaluates each block's relevance to the query. If a block doesn't seem relevant, it’s removed. This is done first with a simpler model that works quickly, then refined with a more detailed model, creating a cleaner, shorter HTML document that still retains valuable context.",

HtmlRAG performed impressively well, often surpassing traditional plain-text retrieval methods. Notably, it managed to retain high accuracy without significantly increasing computational costs.",

Instead of losing details in translation, HtmlRAG preserves relationships between data elements, which can make AI responses much more accurate and nuanced. Imagine the possibilities in fields like legal, scientific, or technical data retrieval, where the exact formatting and structure are often critical for accurate understanding.",

It means that as language models improve, so too does the potential to use richer, more structured data to inform their responses. HtmlRAG shows us that we don’t necessarily have to simplify or discard complex information structures—rather, we can adapt the retrieval process to include them, providing more sophisticated and trustworthy answers.",
