Imagine a future where aircraft don’t just rely on conventional fuels but glide across the skies powered by liquid hydrogen and superconducting technology. That’s the future Airbus and Toshiba are envisioning—and it's closer than you think.",

This partnership aims to develop a two-megawatt motor, and it’s all about making aviation more efficient, greener, and—ultimately—zero-emission by 2050. But how exactly are they planning to do this?",

By using superconducting materials, which are cooled by liquid hydrogen at temperatures as low as minus 253 degrees Celsius, these systems can drastically enhance the efficiency of electric propulsion—allowing higher power output with less energy loss.",

In fact, they’ve been experimenting with hydrogen technology for a while, and they have a larger vision called the ZEROe project. The goal is to launch the first commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035, and they’re tackling this challenge with both hydrogen combustion engines and hydrogen fuel cells. It’s about combining futuristic technologies to not only reduce emissions but also revolutionize aircraft design and performance.",

They’ve already developed a two-megawatt-class superconducting motor prototype, designed for mobility applications, and now they’re working with Airbus to apply this in aviation. Imagine planes that generate more power but use significantly less energy, thanks to superconducting efficiency. The collaboration between these two giants marks a pivotal moment—one that could redefine how we think about sustainable flight.",

Well, aviation is a significant contributor to global emissions, and finding a viable path toward carbon-neutral flight is a crucial part of the puzzle if we want to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Hydrogen-powered planes with superconducting motors could make this a reality. These innovations are a testament to the incredible power of technology to transform not just industries, but our entire world.",

With superconducting technologies, it’s not just about making engines better—it’s about opening up completely new design possibilities. Lighter planes, more efficient power transmission, and perhaps even radically different shapes and propulsion systems—all of this could be made possible with this technology.",
