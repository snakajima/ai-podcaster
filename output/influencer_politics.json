For starters, both campaigns recognized that creators—whether on podcasts, TikTok, or other platforms—hold a unique influence over their audiences. But the approach to using these platforms couldn’t have been more different.",

His campaign made strategic appearances on popular podcasts, such as *The Joe Rogan Experience* and shows by the *All-In Podcast* crew and *Logan Paul*. In total, Trump showed up on over 20 different shows, which is quite a bit more than Kamala Harris’s four appearances.",

      "text": "Trump’s outreach included not only podcast listeners but a wider network of social media personalities, particularly those with a more conservative lean. A major factor was the support he received from Elon Musk, now the owner of X—formerly Twitter. Musk, with over 200 million followers, was actively vocal in his support for Trump, especially after a July incident that tried to target Trump’s safety. This endorsement acted as a powerful megaphone, helping Trump reach audiences in a way that few traditional endorsements could.",

      "text": "Harris, on the other hand, took a more traditional approach, relying on endorsements from celebrities like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. Although these names carry a lot of weight, the impact wasn’t quite the same as Musk’s relentless support. Celebrity endorsement might still resonate, but for younger voters, a major influencer may be more persuasive than traditional stars.",

      "text": "But here’s what’s really interesting: despite her campaign bringing in over 200 influencers to the Democratic National Convention—a full hundred more than the RNC—it didn’t generate the same engagement as Trump’s appearances. Analysts think this might be because Harris’s campaign focused more on influencer engagement without honing in on her message. Some of her online support felt fleeting, like the summer trend around coconut tree memes and 'brat' summer memes. While these were popular, they didn’t convey much about her policies or platform.",

By aligning himself with influencers who connect with this demographic, Trump flipped the vote among 18-to-29-year-old men, a group that Biden had previously won by a solid margin in 2020.",
