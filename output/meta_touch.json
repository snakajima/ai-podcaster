Our focus is on touch perception, dexterity, and human-robot interaction—essential components that could make future robots not only more capable but also more relatable.",

They can reach out, grasp objects, understand textures, even differentiate between something as delicate as a flower petal and something as firm as a coffee mug. It sounds like science fiction, but Meta's FAIR team is working to make this a reality. Their latest efforts focus on giving robots an essential sense—the sense of touch.",

And it's all about turning artificial intelligence into something more embodied—in other words, AI that isn't just in our phones or our computers, but in the physical, tangible world around us. You can find the full article at ai.meta.com/blog/fair-robotics-open-source, and I'll be drawing from that today.",

      "text": "Meta's researchers are making big strides with a set of new tools that push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics. Let me introduce you to Meta Sparsh, the first general-purpose encoder for vision-based tactile sensing. The name 'Sparsh' comes from Sanskrit, meaning 'touch,' which is quite fitting for a technology meant to help robots understand the world through a sense that's been elusive until now. Sparsh uses advances in self-supervised learning, which allows it to learn from the physical world without needing meticulously labeled data. Imagine a robot that's capable of feeling its way around—understanding the slipperiness of a surface or the firmness of an object without needing thousands of examples.",

      "text": "But that's not all. Meta has also introduced Digit 360, an artificial fingertip that can do some incredible things. Picture a fingertip that not only detects the pressure and force of a touch but can sense vibrations, heat, and even odors. Digit 360 has over 18 sensing features and can perceive forces as small as one millinewton. The research team likens it to having a robot's version of a human peripheral nervous system—a system that can react to stimuli locally and almost instantaneously, much like our reflexes. This kind of capability is crucial for a future where robots could be assisting in surgery, helping out in hazardous environments, or simply making our lives at home a little easier.",

It's like giving a robot the ability to feel through every part of its hand, from fingertips to palm. This kind of tactile perception will be key for robots that need to manipulate delicate objects or perform dexterous tasks. Imagine a robot helping a factory worker by picking up parts or packaging items—tasks that are simple for a human but extremely challenging for a machine without this sense of touch.",

      "text": "And it's not just about the physical world. Meta's research team is also looking at the social and collaborative aspect of robotics. They introduced a new benchmark called PARTNR—a standardized framework for evaluating planning and reasoning in human-robot collaboration. PARTNR is designed to make sure that AI agents can not only perform tasks on their own but can also work side by side with humans, taking into account physical-world constraints like time and space. It's a step toward a future where robots are not just tools, but real partners in our daily lives.",

GelSight will manufacture and distribute Digit 360, which is expected to be available next year. Meanwhile, Wonik Robotics will be producing a new robotic hand, fully integrated with Meta Digit Plexus, set to launch soon as well. This collaboration will help researchers worldwide access these innovations and advance the field of tactile robotics even further.",
