Napster—the original peer-to-peer file-sharing service—had already turned the music industry upside down with the concept of free, downloadable music, though it was mostly illegal. The music industry was scrambling to counteract piracy and regain control. That’s when Rhapsody entered the picture in 2001.",

For a monthly subscription fee, users could access an extensive, licensed music catalog and stream songs over the internet. This was revolutionary—a paid, legal alternative to the piracy that Napster had popularized. Rhapsody brought legitimacy to digital music, and for the first time, people could access a library of songs on-demand without the threat of copyright lawsuits.",

However, despite Rhapsody’s early innovation, it faced some significant challenges. At that time, Rhapsody was only available on desktop computers in the U.S. It struggled to expand to mobile platforms, which became a significant barrier as devices like the iPod and smartphones were changing how people accessed media.",

By then, competitors like Spotify had entered the scene. Spotify launched in Sweden in 2008 with a freemium model—free for users who could tolerate ads, or ad-free with a premium subscription. It was mobile-ready, user-friendly, and offered social features like playlist sharing, making it a magnet for users worldwide.",
