That's up from 11 million last quarter, and more than double compared to the same time last year. Snapchat+ costs just $3.99 a month, and although it doesn't represent a huge chunk of Snap's overall revenue, it's definitely playing a key role in boosting growth.",

However, non-ad revenue, most of which comes from Snapchat+, helped Snap reach an overall revenue increase of 15%, hitting $1.37 billion. It's interesting to see how these supplementary revenues are making a real difference for Snap.",

Snap later turned this feature off by default, citing concerns over user wellbeing. Despite that, the growth of Snapchat+ seems pretty promising.",

While global user growth is on the rise, this flatlining in its largest market has been a concern for Snap. But Snap isn’t just standing still; the company is working to attract more creators to its platform, and it's making a major push to grow its augmented reality efforts. In fact, the number of creators posting content increased by 50% compared to last year.",

Google reported that YouTube’s revenue from ads and subscriptions over the past four quarters crossed $50 billion for the first time, which means YouTube is now bigger than Netflix in terms of revenue. For this quarter alone, YouTube's ad revenue increased by 12%, reaching $8.9 billion.",

They're concentrating on making YouTube more watchable on big screens, and they're also giving creators more tools to make content feel more like traditional TV, with options to organize videos into seasons. This really plays into the trend of blurring the lines between online content and traditional television.",

Apparently, 70% of channels uploading to YouTube each month are now uploading Shorts, and they’re also working on ways to make watching these Shorts less awkward on TV screens.
