And with Meta AI and Llama rapidly becoming key parts of the industry, we’re seeing how Meta is positioning itself not only as a leader in social networking but also as a major force in AI development.",

      "text": "Let's start by talking about Meta's AI efforts. Meta AI, their generative AI assistant, has now surpassed 500 million monthly active users. Imagine the kind of scale that requires. Improvements in their AI-driven feed and video recommendations have boosted engagement across both Facebook and Instagram—up 8% and 6% respectively this year. Those aren’t just numbers; they’re proof of how AI is transforming user experience on a massive scale.",

This quarter, Meta released Llama 3.2, which includes on-device models and open-source multimodal capabilities. They've even been working with the U.S. government to integrate Llama into public sector operations. Zuckerberg sees Llama as a pivotal piece of Meta's strategy, making AI more customizable and cost-effective, ultimately setting a new benchmark for what AI can do across industries.",

      "text": "But what's perhaps even more exciting is the next chapter—Llama 4. Zuckerberg talked about how they’re training Llama 4 on a cluster of more than 100,000 H100 GPUs, making it one of the largest and most powerful AI models ever. Early next year, the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready, promising better reasoning capabilities, new modalities, and faster responses. This push for open-source AI models could mean lower costs and more trustworthiness, as these models will be available to developers across the world, shaping the future of AI integration.",

One of the standout moments from the earnings call was Meta’s new developments in wearables, specifically their collaboration with Ray-Ban on the Meta smart glasses. These glasses are not just for taking photos or making calls anymore; they now integrate Meta AI, allowing users to interact with their environment in real-time. You can ask questions, get reminders, and even receive real-time translations—all while just wearing your glasses. They’re essentially bringing the power of a virtual assistant into your daily life, hands-free.",

These glasses represent the culmination of a decade of research and show a future where AR and the physical world blend seamlessly. Imagine being able to feel present with anyone, anywhere, just by wearing glasses that project a holographic representation of that person. This might still sound a bit futuristic, but Meta is making it happen—step by step.",
