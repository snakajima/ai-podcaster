With advances in AI, machine learning, and robotics, we’re beginning to see human-like robots become a reality. But what exactly are companies like Tesla, Figure AI, 1X, and Unitree Robotics doing in this space? And how close are we to having a humanoid robot that can help out at home or at work?",

      "text": "Let’s start with one of the most well-known players: Tesla. You might have heard about Tesla’s Optimus, also known as the Tesla Bot. First announced in 2021, Tesla's vision for Optimus is a humanoid that stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs about 125 pounds. It's capable of carrying up to 45 pounds and uses many of the same AI systems found in Tesla's self-driving cars. The idea behind Optimus is to handle repetitive, mundane tasks—imagine a robot that could help carry groceries or move boxes in a warehouse.",

      "text": "Elon Musk has said that limited production of Optimus could start as early as 2025, and the price point they’re aiming for is between $20,000 to $30,000. However, it's important to take some of these demonstrations with a grain of salt. There are reports suggesting that some of the early demonstrations of Optimus were teleoperated by humans rather than being fully autonomous, which shows how challenging it is to make these robots truly self-sufficient. Nevertheless, Tesla has big ambitions, and Optimus could very well become a household name in the future.",

      "text": "Next up is a lesser-known but exciting player: Figure AI. Founded in 2022, Figure AI is solely focused on building general-purpose humanoid robots. Their first model, Figure 01, is being developed with an eye on commercial applications, particularly in manufacturing and logistics. In early 2024, they announced a partnership with BMW, aiming to deploy their robots in automotive manufacturing. This partnership marks an interesting step towards integrating humanoids in industries where precision and efficiency are crucial.",

Their humanoid robot, NEO, is designed for general-purpose tasks across various environments. 1X puts a lot of emphasis on developing cognitive AI to make their robots more adaptable and advanced. The key here is safe human-robot interaction. They want robots that aren’t just useful but also safe and reliable, especially in environments where they work alongside humans. This focus on safety could be crucial for getting people comfortable with the idea of robots in their everyday lives.",

      "text": "Finally, we have Unitree Robotics. Now, if that name sounds familiar, it might be because they’ve already made a splash with their quadruped robots, which look a lot like Boston Dynamics' Spot. But Unitree is also working on a humanoid called H1. H1 is a full-size humanoid robot, but unlike Tesla's Optimus or Figure 01, it's mainly targeted at research and development. The expertise Unitree has gathered from their quadrupeds is feeding into their humanoid projects, particularly in areas like balance and locomotion—something that’s notoriously hard to get right in humanoid robots.",

Tesla wants a robot in every home or factory, Figure AI aims to revolutionize commercial logistics, 1X is focusing on safe and adaptable robots, and Unitree is bringing their experience in robot mobility to the table. The field is advancing quickly, and while we're not quite at the point where everyone has a humanoid butler, we're certainly getting closer.",
