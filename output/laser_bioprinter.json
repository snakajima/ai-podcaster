Imagine a future where we no longer need to rely on animal testing, where we can quickly develop human tissues to test new drugs or even grow replacement tissues for medical treatments. This future is closer than you think, thanks to some amazing research happening at ETH Zurich.",

Their work is all about precision and replication—building tissues that are almost identical to natural ones. The source for today’s episode is an article titled 'Lab-made muscle: New laser tech grows real human tissues to replace lab rats,' which you can find on Interesting Engineering. I’ve included the link in the description below.",

      "text": "So, how does this work? Dr. Liu and his team use a type of 3D bioprinter called the filamented light, or FLight, 3D bioprinter. It's a cutting-edge tool that utilizes laser beams to create aligned structures within a hydrogel matrix. Essentially, the laser passes through a light-sensitive gelatin, which hardens when exposed to the laser light, forming the scaffold that cells can grow on.",

      "text": "These scaffolds are really interesting—they’re made up of highly aligned microfilaments, which means the cells grow in an organized manner, much like they do in our muscles, tendons, and nerves. This organization is crucial because it allows the tissue to mimic the natural structure and function of human tissues.",

      "text": "The FLight 3D bioprinter uses an optical phenomenon that creates areas of high and low energy intensity in the laser beam. This results in thread-like, filamented structures with tiny channels in between. Cells are then introduced into these scaffolds, and they grow along those channels, forming highly aligned tissue constructs.",

Imagine being able to create a piece of human muscle, tendon, or even nerve tissue to test how a new drug will interact with it—without ever needing to involve animal testing. It’s not only ethical but could also provide much more accurate data.",
