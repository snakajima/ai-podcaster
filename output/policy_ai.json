      "text": "So, why is this important? Well, artificial intelligence in the military domain has vast potential, but also enormous risks. When AI is used for autonomous systems, especially weapons, the stakes are incredibly high. A lack of ethical guidelines could lead to unintended consequences, or even a global arms race for autonomous military systems. That's why the declaration aims to create a set of shared understandings and responsible practices for the development, deployment, and use of AI in military applications.",

This was a crucial first step to operationalize the declaration and bring these guidelines to life. The United States has also pledged to keep the dialogue going through regular meetings with endorsing countries. The hope is that these efforts will help prevent misuse, accidents, and even conflicts that could arise from the unchecked use of military AI.",
