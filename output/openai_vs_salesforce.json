This episode is based on an insightful piece from *The Information*, titled 'Corporate Spending on OpenAI Threatens Salesforce, Other Enterprise Apps,' by Aaron Holmes.",

      "text": "So, here’s the big picture: while AI is positioned as the next transformative technology for the business world, companies are making room for these new tools within existing budgets rather than expanding them. This means they’re reducing spending in other areas, particularly on established enterprise applications and non-AI cloud services. Companies that provide these legacy applications, like Salesforce, may start to feel the financial pinch.",

Their CIO, Viral Tripathi, shared that C1 has carved out about 5-8% of their IT budget specifically for conversational AI, including a new customer service chatbot. Additionally, they’re developing their own AI-powered customer relationship management, or CRM, software, using models from OpenAI. This strategy, C1 believes, will allow them to save on enterprise apps and reduce overall IT expenses.",

Salesforce’s own marketing executive, Patrick Stokes, argues that trying to replace established enterprise apps with AI may not be worth the cost or complexity, especially given the integration of deep workflows within Salesforce and similar applications. So while AI is gaining traction, Salesforce believes companies may ultimately find it more difficult than expected to fully switch away.",

Companies are using language models for various tasks—everything from customer support automation to internal data processing. For instance, mortgage lending firm Rocket Companies built AI tools to extract data from mortgage documents and streamline customer support, replacing or 'sunsetting' older, more manual systems.",

Microsoft, for example, attributes a significant portion of its cloud revenue growth to AI, though it primarily comes from its collaboration with OpenAI. Amazon’s AWS is benefiting similarly through a partnership with Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor.",

Autodesk, for instance, implemented AI models for customer support and saw a 63% boost in productivity.
