This is exactly what's happening in the world of large language models, or LLMs. The better an LLM can code, the more rigorous its reasoning abilities become, and, as a result, the more capable it becomes at answering questions across a wide range of domains.",

According to the article, improving coding capabilities actually enhances an AI model's ability to answer other types of questions effectively. Coding, with its precise logic and requirements for structured thinking, trains these models to become more reliable in generating answers across all sorts of contexts.",

Google was quick to follow suit, striking a multimillion-dollar deal with Turing to put hundreds of programmers to work evaluating their AI models. Google knew they were behind OpenAI, and they wanted to catch up. In a matter of months, Turing had over 500 programmers working on thousands of coding tasks to improve Google’s AI models.",
