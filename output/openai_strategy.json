      "text": "Today, we’re diving into a fascinating development in the world of artificial intelligence. As reported by *The Information*, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is facing some new hurdles—and they’re not just technical. The rate of progress for large language models, or LLMs, seems to be slowing down, prompting OpenAI to shift its strategy and explore new ways to keep pushing the envelope.",

      "text": "So, what does that mean? Well, OpenAI has found that while the number of people using its products, like ChatGPT, is skyrocketing, the actual gains in model quality aren’t improving at the pace they once were. In fact, the leap in capabilities from GPT-3 to GPT-4 was significant, but now, they’re seeing diminishing returns as they work on their next flagship model, code-named 'Orion.'",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "According to OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, when Orion was about 20% through its training process, it was already on par with GPT-4 in terms of answering questions and performing tasks. But even though Orion’s performance has eventually exceeded GPT-4, it didn’t show the same kind of quantum leap that OpenAI experienced in past upgrades. That’s raising new questions about how these models are evolving.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "Now, OpenAI is grappling with a dilemma that could impact the entire AI field. The problem here revolves around something called ‘scaling laws.’ These scaling laws predict that as long as you feed a model more data and add more computational power, it will keep getting better. But what happens when there’s not enough data to maintain that pace? Or when the improvement starts costing exponentially more for smaller and smaller gains?",

      "text": "One major hurdle is the limited availability of high-quality data. OpenAI and other developers have already tapped into much of the publicly available data, from books to web pages, and it’s no longer enough to fuel substantial improvements. To address this, OpenAI has formed a new ‘foundations’ team, led by Nick Ryder, to explore ways to extend the lifespan of existing data sources. They’re also experimenting with AI-generated, or synthetic, data—essentially training Orion on output from older models like GPT-4.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "But synthetic data has its own set of problems. Since these AI models were trained on previous models’ outputs, there’s a risk that Orion could end up resembling its predecessors in some ways. This could lead to stagnation, where new models don't feel fundamentally new or improved.",

      "text": "As a result, OpenAI and other companies are shifting their focus toward what’s known as 'post-training.' This involves tuning the models for specific tasks after the initial training phase. For example, they’re using techniques like reinforcement learning, where models learn from examples of correct answers to various problems, like math and coding challenges. By focusing on task-specific training, they can make the models better without needing vast new data sets.",

      "text": "One particularly interesting development here is something called a ‘reasoning model,’ named 'o1.' These reasoning models are built to take more time to process and analyze data before giving a response. So, unlike standard LLMs, which deliver quick answers, these models are designed to ‘think’ a bit longer, improving the quality of their answers on tasks that require deeper reasoning. The o1 model can even adjust its performance based on the computing power available at the time, opening up a whole new dimension of AI response quality.",

As Altman noted in recent interviews, reasoning models might help AI finally tackle things like advanced scientific research or complex code writing—tasks that have previously been just out of reach for these systems.",

Some experts, like Ben Horowitz, point out that despite ramping up computational resources, the improvements aren’t keeping pace. Others, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, are optimistic, saying that there’s still plenty of room to build transformative applications on top of existing AI tech, even if model quality doesn’t grow at the same rate.",

OpenAI and other AI leaders are still investing heavily in new data centers, expanding their compute capabilities, and pushing forward with the hope that scaling laws can carry them just a bit further. But researchers are also preparing for a world where model improvement may depend on creative techniques and new types of data, rather than traditional scaling alone.",
