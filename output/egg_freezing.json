We'll explore one woman's experience with the process, understand the science behind it, and talk about how this technology could shape the future of fertility. I'm talking about an insightful story shared by Luzia Bruckamp in her blog post titled 'My Egg Freezing Experience'. You can find the full post at luziabruckamp.com, and I'll include the link in our episode description.",

      "text": "Now, what is egg freezing, and why are people considering it more and more today? Well, egg freezing is a procedure that allows individuals to preserve their eggs for future use. It's an option many people turn to when they want to have kids someday, but aren't quite ready for them now. This could be for personal, professional, or medical reasons. And thanks to advances in fertility medicine, egg freezing has become a viable way for people to extend their reproductive options.",

      "text": "Luzia's experience, as she shares, was based on a desire to give herself the choice to have children in the future without the uncertainty of age-related fertility decline. She underwent a cycle of egg freezing in the UK, and as she details, it was quite the journey. From the initial fertility assessments to the hormone injections and the eventual egg retrieval, Luzia gives us a real, honest look into the process.",

      "text": "One of the things that stood out in her story is the data-driven approach Luzia took to make her decision. She analyzed the available data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. The HFEA dataset spans almost three decades and captures the vast majority of IVF and egg freezing treatments in the UK. It's a treasure trove of information for anyone considering these procedures, and Luzia used it to evaluate success rates by age, comparing outcomes for women using their own eggs versus donor eggs.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "The data shows that fertility declines significantly with age, and this decline is mostly due to the reduction in the quality and quantity of eggs. However, the ability to carry a pregnancy remains fairly stable. By freezing her eggs now, Luzia is essentially stopping the clock on her eggs' aging process, which means her future chances of pregnancy will be closer to the rate they would have been at the age she froze them.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "But what does the data say about success rates? Luzia points out that the success rates for older patients using their own eggs are unfortunately quite low. In the HFEA data, for patients aged 43 and older, only about 14% were able to achieve a live birth using their own eggs. In contrast, those who used donor eggs, often from younger donors, had much higher success rates. This insight made Luzia realize that freezing her eggs at a younger age could significantly improve her future chances of success.",

      "text": "The process, as Luzia describes it, wasn't without its challenges. She went through hormone injections, regular ultrasounds, and eventually the egg retrieval procedure itself. There were emotional ups and downs, including uncertainty over how many eggs would be retrieved and whether they would be of good quality. In her case, 14 eggs were collected, but only 8 were mature enough to be frozen. While this was a bit below her expectations, it's still a step towards giving her future self the possibility of having children.",

      "text": "Another interesting point Luzia makes is about the choice between freezing eggs and freezing embryos. If you have a partner, freezing embryos might provide a bit more certainty, as the embryos generally have higher survival rates after thawing compared to eggs. But of course, there's a big trade-off—freezing embryos ties you to that particular partner, whereas freezing eggs keeps your options open in case things change in your relationship.",

The entire process can be expensive—she estimated the cost for her first cycle at around £6,700, including medication. And while the procedure is generally safe, there are risks like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which can cause discomfort or even serious health complications.",

She also highlights that even if you're not sure about freezing your eggs, getting a fertility assessment—checking your anti-Mullerian hormone levels and antral follicle count—can be a great first step. It's relatively inexpensive and can give you a sense of whether age-related infertility might be a concern for you.",

It's expensive, it's invasive, and there's no guarantee you'll need or use those eggs in the future. But for some, like Luzia, it provides peace of mind—a way to extend your reproductive window and have the option to start a family on your own timeline.",
