Imagine a world where robots can clean your home, fold laundry, bus tables, and even assemble boxes with little to no human intervention. We’re talking about pi-0, the first generalist robot policy by Physical Intelligence. This new foundation model could completely reshape what robots can do in real-world, messy environments outside of structured factory settings.",

AI has made remarkable advances in recent years, mastering tasks like playing chess, generating hyper-realistic images, and even predicting protein structures. But there’s been a significant gap: robots that can interact seamlessly with our physical world. For instance, a game of chess is ‘easy’ for AI, but folding a shirt or packing a box has remained out of reach. This is where the pi-0 model comes in, as a major leap forward in giving robots what we call 'physical intelligence.'",

This includes everything from bussing dishes to packing items and even folding clothes. Each of these tasks involves a different set of movements, objects, and environments. By training on such diverse data, pi-0 has started to gain an understanding of physical interactions that previously would have required extensive manual programming for each specific task.",

      "text": "So how does it work? pi-0 isn’t just like any other AI model. It was designed to handle text, images, and actions all at once, taking in commands in text form but then translating those into physical actions. Instead of just focusing on interpreting language, pi-0 connects that understanding with motor control, making it possible to output continuous, real-time movements — up to 50 times per second, in fact. This allows for more dexterous and responsive interactions with the physical world.",

Instead, it draws on its diverse training data and general understanding to adapt on the spot. And just like language models that can be fine-tuned, pi-0 can also be specialized for more complex or precise applications, such as laundry folding or table bussing, where it was able to recognize items, sort them, and even stack dishes.",
