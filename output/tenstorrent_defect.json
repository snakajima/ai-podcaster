Now, unlike traditional GPUs, which are used for a broad range of computing purposes, these cards are specifically architected to handle AI workloads—and they do so in a pretty unique way.",

      "text": "Let’s visualize these cards. Imagine you’re holding one of them in your hands. Once you take off the shell and heatsinks, you’ll see the underlying circuit board. On top, there are two QSFP-DD cages for ethernet—these are primarily used to directly connect multiple cards using high-speed data cables. Along the left edge, you’ll find the PCIe 4.0 connector, which allows the card to plug directly into your computer's motherboard, enabling super-fast data transfer between the Wormhole ASIC and the host.",

      "text": "Now, at the heart of these cards is the Wormhole ASIC—essentially the processing brain of the card. The n150s has one ASIC, while the n300s has two. Each of these ASICs is surrounded by six GDDR6 memory chips, giving the ASICs the bandwidth they need to process large datasets quickly. The n150s card ends up with a single Wormhole ASIC, while the n300s card has two, allowing it to handle more complex tasks by leveraging internal networking between the two ASICs.",

    {

      "text": "The layout of these ASICs is interesting—Tenstorrent uses a grid of tiles approach, specifically a 10 by 12 grid. Each tile has its own unique function, whether it’s handling ethernet communication, interacting with memory, or routing data within the chip itself. Think of this grid as a city map, with each neighborhood contributing something specific to keep the whole system running efficiently.",

      "duration": 25.68
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "One key feature is the communication between these tiles. Each tile can communicate with its north, south, east, and west neighbors, with connections that are 32 bytes wide. These connections make it possible for data to move through the system in a highly efficient manner, but here’s the kicker—the edges of the grid are actually connected to the opposite edges. It’s like if you walked off the east side of a map and magically appeared on the west side. This helps reduce the latency for certain types of operations, making sure data can get from point A to point B as quickly as possible.",

      "text": "Now, let’s talk about the second ASIC on the n300s card. Unlike the first ASIC, it isn’t directly connected to the PCIe bus. Instead, the two ASICs are linked internally via ethernet. That means, if the host computer wants to communicate with the second ASIC, it has to go through the first ASIC first. It’s like sending a message to a friend by asking their roommate to pass it along. While this adds a bit of complexity, it’s an efficient way to scale up the processing capabilities without requiring additional direct PCIe connections.",

      "text": "Another interesting aspect is how Tenstorrent deals with manufacturing defects. In large-scale production, defects are inevitable. Rather than discarding an entire ASIC, Tenstorrent 'harvests' rows of tiles that might have issues. They essentially disable an entire row of tiles if even one tile is faulty. This strategy allows them to still use these chips without compromising overall reliability. For example, on the n150s card, even though each ASIC starts with 80 T tiles, only 72 are usable. On the n300s card, each ASIC has 64 usable T tiles out of an original 80.",
