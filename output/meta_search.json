According to an article by Kalley Huang on The Information, titled 'Meta Develops AI Search Engine to Lessen Reliance on Google, Microsoft,' Meta is working on a brand-new AI search engine. The goal? To reduce its dependence on Google Search and Microsoft's Bing for providing information to users through its AI chatbot, Meta AI.",

The company has already introduced Meta AI as an integrated chatbot in its various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. But, up until now, Meta has relied on Google and Microsoft to power the search functionality of its chatbot, especially for queries about current events, news, sports, and stocks.",

      "text": "Meta's move to develop its own search engine is quite significant. Think about it: relying on your competitors to power key functionalities of your own services is a tricky game. It means that Google or Microsoft could, at any point, decide to pull the plug on their support, leaving Meta's chatbot in a precarious position. By developing its own web-crawling technology, Meta is trying to ensure that its AI capabilities are self-sufficient, and not at the mercy of others.",

Their team has been focused on accessing websites, indexing their pages, and organizing them into databases—much like how traditional search engines operate. The plan is for Meta AI to eventually use these web indices to answer relevant questions.",

In August, Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that Meta AI already has over 185 million weekly active users, a number that suggests it is quickly catching up to OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has over 250 million weekly users. The distinction here is that while ChatGPT has been popular with software engineers for generating or vetting code, Meta AI's integration across its social platforms means that it reaches an entirely different audience—one that’s more focused on social interactions, content, and real-time events.",

Just a few years ago, changes made by Apple significantly impacted Meta’s ability to generate ad revenue through its iPhone apps.

By building its own search engine and reducing reliance on Google and Microsoft, Meta is setting the stage for a more independent and potentially transformative AI ecosystem. This also means more competition in the search engine market, which could ultimately be good for innovation and for us as consumers.",
