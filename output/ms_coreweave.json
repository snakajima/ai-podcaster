Microsoft plans to spend around $10 billion on CoreWeave’s services by the end of this decade, which is a substantial portion of CoreWeave’s projected $17 billion in signed contracts. That’s a hefty commitment from a company CoreWeave considers competition!",

They expect a fourfold increase, reaching around $8 billion. All of this growth is expected to help the startup turn a profit, though they’ll likely still be using their capital heavily for expansion.",
