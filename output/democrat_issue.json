Our topic stems from an insightful blog post by Noah Smith, on his blog Noahpinion, titled 'The Educated Professional Class is Out of Touch with America.' This piece is a response to recent shifts in U.S. politics, especially the divide between the highly educated and the rest of the country. You can find the full article at www.noahpinion.blog. So let’s talk about why the professional class might be losing touch and what this means for America.",

      "text": "In the article, Noah Smith discusses how the Democrats’ core base has been shifting away from the working class and increasingly attracting the highly educated professional class. This shift has created a divide that some say is becoming a fundamental problem for Democrats when it comes to reaching voters without college degrees. It’s something that, interestingly enough, even recent U.S. elections have highlighted. Trump and the GOP are winning more support from non-college voters, including certain Hispanic groups and even urban populations. Meanwhile, Democrats find themselves holding onto an educated base but struggling to connect with a broader audience.",

      "text": "So why does this divide matter? Well, if we look at the big picture, it reveals a significant gap in values, beliefs, and even the kinds of information people consume. According to Smith, this split between the professional class and the rest of America has grown over the years, contributing to a deeply polarized political landscape.",

      "text": "Smith argues that many of the issues that concern Trump’s base are ones that hit the working class harder than they do educated professionals. Things like inflation, public safety, and a sense of national identity often resonate more with these voters than with highly educated, urban professionals. For many in the professional class, ideas around social justice, environmental policies, and immigration reform are front and center. These are undeniably important issues, but the concern is that they may sometimes seem disconnected from the everyday struggles of working-class Americans.",

Take, for example, support for social justice initiatives or efforts to curb climate change. They’ve become cultural cornerstones within educated circles, but for people facing immediate issues like job insecurity or rising costs, they can seem distant or even alienating.",

But data shows otherwise. College enrollment has been dropping, and recent figures reveal that fewer Americans are graduating from college than in past years. Why? Because rising tuition and decreasing wage benefits make college less attractive.",

With fewer people viewing college as a gateway to economic success, the traditional assumptions about an ever-growing professional class simply don’t hold up. This could mean that, long-term, the Democratic Party faces an uphill battle if it doesn’t find a way to speak to non-college voters in a way that resonates.",

This suggests a potential shift among even some in the educated elite, possibly driven by frustrations with what they see as overly 'woke' attitudes among progressive circles.",

The highly educated have grown up in environments—universities, media circles—where progressive ideals are prevalent, sometimes to the point where they become cultural norms. But that’s not the lived reality for a majority of Americans, and Smith believes that’s where Democrats might be losing touch.",
