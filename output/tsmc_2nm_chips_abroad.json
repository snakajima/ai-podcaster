This law essentially forces TSMC to keep its most advanced manufacturing within Taiwan’s borders. J.W. Kuo, Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs, emphasized that while TSMC might eventually produce these advanced chips abroad, the core technologies will remain in Taiwan to safeguard the nation’s technological assets.",

However, he did mention that some adjustments might occur, suggesting flexibility in the face of political shifts. This suggests that while there is some sensitivity to U.S. policies, Taiwan sees this partnership as steady and resilient.",
