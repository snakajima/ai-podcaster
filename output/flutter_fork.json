You may have heard some rumblings about this, but I want to take you through the whole story—why Flutter is being forked, what Flock aims to do, and why this might just be the change that the Flutter community needs.",

      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "So, first, what is Flutter? Flutter is a UI toolkit created by Google that has gained immense popularity over the years. It started as a mobile toolkit for iOS and Android, then expanded to include web, desktop, and even embedded devices. This means developers can write one codebase and deploy it across multiple platforms. Pretty cool, right?",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "But here's where the issue comes in: despite Flutter’s rapid growth, the size of the development team at Google didn't grow enough to keep up. Imagine trying to support millions of developers across all these platforms, with only about 50 people on your team. That’s like having a small town’s worth of firefighters trying to serve an entire country. It’s a tough situation, and the community has started to feel the strain.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "One of the core challenges has been a lack of sufficient labor to address tickets and fix bugs in a timely manner. Many developers have reported that their issues lingered for months, even years, without resolution. This is partly because the Flutter team had its headcount frozen in 2023, and even experienced some layoffs earlier in 2024. This resulted in delays, frustration, and ultimately led some teams to abandon Flutter entirely.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "On top of that, Google's focus shifted towards AI, leading to a deprioritization of the desktop versions of Flutter. Now, the desktop is a huge opportunity for Flutter, as it could provide developers with an all-in-one toolkit for apps across mobile, web, and desktop. But with Google putting desktop on the back burner, it’s been stagnating.",

      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "So, what’s the solution? A group of developers decided to fork Flutter. They call it Flock—like a flock of birds, a community moving together. The idea behind Flock is to take everything great about Flutter and build upon it, adding the features and fixes that the Flutter team at Google can’t or won’t focus on.",

      "text": "Flock also wants to address the labor shortage by recruiting more contributors and making it easier for them to get involved. One of the big pain points for contributing to Flutter has been the lengthy and sometimes frustrating review process. The current Flutter team is stretched too thin—they have to write code, fix bugs, and review contributions. This means that reviews often take a long time, and the process can feel unwelcoming to new contributors.",

They want reviewers who are ready to help contributors cross the finish line, even if it means stepping in to assist with the final tweaks.",

The Flock team wants to make their fixes and improvements available to Flutter, allowing the Google team to integrate them if and when they choose. This way, Flock users get access to these features right away, without having to wait for Google's timeline.",

They’re asking developers to alpha test the fork, become reviewers, and even step up as leads for specific areas of the project. They want this to be a community-driven effort that helps propel Flutter—and now Flock—to new heights.",

So, if you’re a developer who loves Flutter but has felt the frustrations of its current pace, maybe it’s time to Flock together.",
