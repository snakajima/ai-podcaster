Imagine a power source that runs indefinitely without any external input, producing electricity directly from hydrogen fusion. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, it might just be closer to reality than you think.",

      "text": "Our story today comes from Interesting Engineering, and it's about a Gibraltar-based company named ENG8, who claim to have reached a major milestone in catalyzed fusion energy production. This breakthrough revolves around a system called 'EnergiCells'. These cells are based on low-energy nuclear reactions, or LENR technology, and according to ENG8, they're capable of operating indefinitely without any external power source. That's right – we're talking about self-powering cells that also produce net electricity.",

      "text": "The main idea here is that EnergiCells fuse hydrogen nuclei, producing not only photons – which means light – but also directly generating electrons, which means electricity. ENG8 says that their EnergiCells can produce electricity in amounts ranging from milliwatts to tens of kilowatts. This makes the technology suitable for everything from small gadgets like your smartphone or laptop, all the way to household appliances, cars, and even industrial-scale applications.",

Imagine a power source that's not only cheaper but also available around the clock, without the need for any expensive fuel inputs. The fuel here is hydrogen, derived from water molecules – something that's both abundant and easily accessible.",

He even called it a significant milestone for catalyzed fusion, especially when compared to traditional hot fusion efforts, which are still struggling to achieve net positive energy.",

However, what's exciting here is that multiple independent validations have already been conducted by organizations like IEP in Portugal. They verified that EnergiCells not only produce net energy but do so with emissions that fall well within EU safety limits.",
