Samsung Electronics, one of the world’s leading chipmakers, has announced it will be shutting down 50% of its foundry production lines to cut costs. This news was first reported by THE CHOSUN DAILY, and if you'd like to read the full article, you can find the link in the episode description.",

      "text": "Now, why is this such a big deal? Well, Samsung is a major player in the global semiconductor industry, and its foundry business has always been crucial to its success. Foundry production is essentially contract chip manufacturing. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm rely on Samsung’s foundries to produce the advanced chips that power our devices—everything from smartphones to data centers.",

      "text": "However, Samsung's foundry business has been struggling lately. According to analysts, the division recorded losses amounting to about 1 trillion won in the third quarter alone. That’s prompted Samsung to take cost-cutting measures, including temporarily shutting down production lines at its facilities in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.",

      "text": "To give you an idea of the scale, Samsung has already shut down over 30% of its 4nm, 5nm, and 7nm production lines and is planning to expand that to 50% by the end of the year. The company is doing this gradually, monitoring orders from clients as they decide which lines to deactivate. Essentially, if there isn't enough demand, they're shutting things down to save on costs—especially electricity costs, which can be significant for foundries operating 24/7.",

      "text": "But what led to this situation? The main issue is that orders have slowed down. Samsung has struggled to secure large-scale orders from big names like Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, and, to make matters worse, orders from Chinese fabless companies—which are semiconductor companies that design chips but don’t manufacture them—have also been weaker than expected. Many of these Chinese companies have delayed projects due to U.S. trade restrictions on China's semiconductor industry. It’s a combination of geopolitical tensions and economic realities, and it’s taking a toll on Samsung's foundry business.",

      "text": "This decision by Samsung to cut down its production is seen by some experts as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes sense from a financial perspective—why keep production lines running at low utilization rates when you’re losing money? On the other hand, it could be detrimental to Samsung’s competitiveness in the foundry sector, particularly against its biggest rival, TSMC.",

As Lee Jong-hwan, a professor of system semiconductor engineering at Sangmyung University, pointed out, focusing too much on cost-cutting could widen the gap between Samsung and TSMC to the point where it becomes exceedingly difficult for Samsung to catch up. And this is particularly concerning as TSMC continues to grow and innovate.",

The world needs more chips, especially as we move into an era dominated by artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and smart devices.

The U.S. has been imposing restrictions to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies, and these restrictions are partly why Chinese companies are pulling back. It’s a complex landscape where economic decisions are deeply intertwined with geopolitical factors.",

For one, we might see Samsung focusing more on its memory chip business, which is where they already have a strong foothold.
