Imagine a world where every child, regardless of their background, gets access to a quality education experience, with tutors that are just as knowledgeable and effective as the best teachers out there. Sound like science fiction? Well, thanks to AI, we might be closer to that future than you think.",

Developed by researchers at Stanford University, this tool isn't here to replace educators; instead, it's designed to support and enhance their work, making tutoring more effective and accessible.",

Essentially, it's a tool that allows tutors to tap into the expertise of experienced teachers during tutoring sessions. Imagine you're a tutor struggling to explain why a student's answer is incorrect. You press a button, and Tutor CoPilot generates helpful suggestions for how you could guide the student towards understanding the problem more deeply. It's like having a master teacher whispering in your ear, offering the best advice just when you need it.",

Maybe it suggests a question the tutor could ask to get the student thinking in a different way or encourages the tutor to focus on how the student approached the problem to begin with. It's all about promoting deeper learning and critical thinking, which is so important when it comes to subjects like math.",

Half of the tutors used Tutor CoPilot while teaching, and the other half did not. The students who had access to the AI-supported tutors were four percentage points more likely to pass their end-of-session assessments—66% versus 62%. Now, that might not sound like a huge difference, but when you're talking about education at scale, it adds up, especially for children who may not otherwise get this level of support.",

Instead of spending thousands of dollars training tutors in person, this system can be used for just $20 per tutor annually. That's a huge cost-saving and makes one-on-one quality tutoring more accessible, especially in districts that struggle with education inequality.",

She said that this tool highlights how AI can augment human-to-human interaction. It's not about replacing teachers or tutors, it's about facilitating better connections and helping tutors learn to approach problems like experienced educators would. That's a powerful concept—using AI not as a substitute but as a companion to make human connections more meaningful.",

Rose Wang, one of the researchers, emphasized that they want to rigorously evaluate the tool before rolling it out more widely. They don't want to waste students' time by using an untested AI system in the classroom. It's refreshing to see a focus on thoughtful implementation rather than just deploying tech for the sake of it.",
