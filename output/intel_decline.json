For years, Intel was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, powering PCs, servers, and eventually, most of the computing devices we used daily.",

      "text": "But as we entered the 2010s, things started to change. Intel began facing challenges that would shake its position at the top. First, let’s talk about Intel’s manufacturing delays. Traditionally, Intel had maintained a lead in chip manufacturing by continually advancing to smaller nodes—moving from 22nm to 14nm and aiming for even smaller. However, as they moved to 10nm and then 7nm, Intel encountered significant roadblocks.",

      "text": "While Intel struggled, competitors like TSMC and Samsung were able to keep advancing, especially with 7nm and 5nm chips. This gave companies like AMD a golden opportunity. AMD, partnering with TSMC, introduced its Ryzen processors, which offered competitive performance and efficiency, effectively winning over both PC gamers and data centers that had long been Intel’s stronghold.",

      "text": "Intel’s issues didn’t end with manufacturing delays. They also attempted to enter the mobile market, an area dominated by ARM-based processors. In the early 2010s, Intel launched the Atom processor, hoping to gain traction in smartphones and tablets. But Atom didn’t perform as expected. ARM processors, like those used by Qualcomm and later Apple’s A-series chips, proved more efficient, making Atom uncompetitive.",

After investing in mobile modem technology, including the acquisition of Infineon’s wireless division, Intel decided to pull the plug in 2019. The final nail was Apple’s decision to settle with Qualcomm, signaling Intel’s exit from the 5G modem market. Apple acquired most of Intel’s modem assets later that year.",

For years, Intel focused on integrated graphics for everyday use, but recently they made a bigger push with Intel Arc, aiming to challenge NVIDIA and AMD in discrete GPUs. Intel’s prior attempts with projects like Larrabee had already failed. While Intel Arc shows promise, breaking into a field dominated by NVIDIA and AMD remains an uphill battle.",

While Intel focused heavily on PC and server markets, ARM-based architectures began to dominate mobile and other emerging sectors, especially with the advent of ARM in the data center and Apple's successful M1 and M2 chips in laptops. As tech shifts towards high-efficiency, low-power designs, Intel has had to catch up rather than lead.",
