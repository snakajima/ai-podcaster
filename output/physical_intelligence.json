Physical Intelligence, a startup based in San Francisco, has just raised an impressive $400 million in funding, boosting its valuation to $2.4 billion. Now, this isn’t just any startup—we’re talking about a company with a mission to bring general-purpose AI into the physical world, aiming to make robots as versatile and adaptive as possible.",

In fact, Bond Capital and some of the big names like Khosla Ventures and Sequoia Capital are also backing the venture. This marks a significant increase in Physical Intelligence's valuation since their seed round back in March, which raised $70 million at a $400 million valuation. So, the company has multiplied its valuation by six times in just a few months.",

The startup’s mission is to create a kind of universal AI model that could power a wide range of robots to perform diverse tasks autonomously. The founders see a future where you can simply tell a robot to do something, and it will be able to adapt and execute the task—whether it's folding laundry, bussing tables, or assembling a box—similar to how we interact with large language models and virtual assistants today.",

Physical Intelligence wants to develop adaptable, general-purpose robots that are closer to what’s known as 'artificial general intelligence,' or AGI. AGI is the concept of AI technology that not only performs one specific task well but can learn and perform a wide range of tasks, approaching or even surpassing human intelligence in some areas.",

This is a big step toward AGI, which, if achieved, would represent a major shift in both AI and robotics. Imagine a future where robots could handle most physical tasks we face in everyday life, from household chores to complex assembly tasks, just by understanding natural language instructions.",
