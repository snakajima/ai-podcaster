Imagine a world where Elon Musk holds significant sway over U.S. policy through the Trump administration, shaping the future of technology and space exploration in a very direct way. It's a story reported by The Guardian, titled 'How a second Trump term could further enrich Elon Musk: There will be some quid pro quo.'",

Well, Trump has already mentioned appointing Musk to a position he dubbed the 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' with a goal to reduce government spending by $2 trillion. Musk has joked about leading a 'Department of Government Efficiency,' or 'DOGE,' and his initiatives could mean deregulation and policy changes across multiple sectors—specifically those impacting Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and X.",

Now, while Trump hasn’t always been a fan of electric vehicles—he’s called them part of a 'Green New Scam'—his stance seemed to soften once Musk threw his weight behind him. Despite this softening, experts predict that Trump’s administration will likely roll back tax credits for EVs, a move that could disadvantage new EV startups. But for Tesla, which has already leveraged those credits to gain a dominant position in the EV market, this could be beneficial.",

Under a Trump administration, Musk’s company could be in line for even more lucrative government deals, especially in broadband via Starlink and even Mars missions. Trump has praised Musk’s space ambitions, describing SpaceX rockets as 'beautiful, shiny white,' and expressing a desire to put an American astronaut on Mars before the end of his next term.",

Neuralink has faced scrutiny from the FDA regarding animal testing protocols and quality controls, but a Trump administration that’s friendly to Musk’s ventures could potentially ease these investigations, creating a clearer path for the company’s experimental projects.",

With Musk’s influence over X, there’s speculation that a Trump administration wouldn’t impose any new regulations on the platform, allowing Musk to continue to shape political discourse as he sees fit. Experts note that any conflicts of interest may go largely unchecked given Trump and Musk’s strong rapport, and this could further boost Musk’s already considerable influence.",
