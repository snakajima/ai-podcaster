Gizmodo reports that Trump has proposed tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese imports. Let’s break down what that could mean for you and your tech.",

      "text": "First, let’s look at why we’ve enjoyed relatively low prices on electronics here in the U.S. For years, affordable tech has been made possible due to a robust trade relationship with China, allowing companies to manufacture electronics like laptops, gaming consoles, and smartphones at lower costs. But Trump’s tariff plan is aimed at shifting this model—he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. by discouraging companies from importing goods through hefty taxes or tariffs.",

      "text": "According to Gizmodo, Trump’s plan includes a 60% tariff on Chinese imports and a general 10-20% tariff on all imports. Now, the problem here is that tariffs don’t actually mean foreign countries pay a fee to bring goods in. Instead, U.S. companies that import these goods from China have to pay the tariff, and they often pass those costs on to us—the consumers. So, if this goes into effect, everything from laptops to gaming consoles could see a serious price jump.",

      "text": "Just to give you an idea of what that would look like, Gizmodo points to a study from the Consumer Technology Association. According to the study, a 60% tariff could mean price spikes across a wide range of products. Laptops, for example, could cost almost 50% more. Smartphones could jump up by around 26%. And if you’re a gamer waiting for the next console, brace yourself: the PS5 Pro, which was expected to be around $500, could cost nearly $1,000. Even a GPU—the kind used for both gaming and AI processing—could go from $900 to $1,300. It’s a huge leap.",

      "text": "What’s the reason behind these tariffs, and why does Trump believe it will help? Trump’s campaign is pushing the idea that the U.S. has a trade imbalance with China, meaning that we import far more than we export. He wants to see more manufacturing done domestically to reduce reliance on Chinese products. But, here’s the reality: even with these tariffs, it’s still a lot more expensive to manufacture in the U.S. So, the study suggests that companies would likely shift production to other countries—not necessarily the U.S.—in order to keep costs down. In the short term, we would see higher prices on electronics, and in the long term, we’d see manufacturing move, but not necessarily back to the U.S.",

      "text": "The Consumer Technology Association calls tariffs ‘regressive taxes.’ What this means is that they impact lower-income households the hardest. So, if prices jump by 40-50% on these essential tech products, the financial strain will be felt most by those who already struggle with tight budgets. Ed Brzytwa, CTA’s Vice President of International Trade, emphasizes that tariffs are a burden on American consumers, not foreign governments.",

During Trump’s first term, the tech industry lobbied hard to avoid similar tariffs, and they succeeded in getting some exemptions for electronics. But it’s uncertain if they’ll be able to pull it off again if Trump returns to office and remains committed to these policies.",
