The idea is to release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere – using aircraft – to reflect sunlight away from the Earth, much like a massive volcanic eruption. It's inspired by the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, which cooled the planet by about half a degree Celsius for almost a year. This approach, called Solar Radiation Management, aims to artificially recreate that effect on a global scale.",
