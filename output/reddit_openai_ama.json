      "text": "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was asked whether AI can or should be used for therapy. He responded, and I quote, 'It's obviously not a therapist, but clearly a lot of people get value out of talking about their problems with it.' He went on to mention that they have seen a lot of startups exploring how AI could be more helpful in this area, and he hopes someone will build something great here. This really highlights how AI can be a useful tool for emotional support, without actually replacing human therapists. What do you think about this? Would you use AI to talk about your challenges, or do you prefer the human connection?",

      "text": "One of the other key highlights was a question on the future of AI models at OpenAI—are they planning to continue releasing 'o-series' models, or will there be a continuation of more traditional versions like GPT-4 and GPT-5? Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s CPO, responded by saying, 'Both! And at some point, I expect they'll converge.' This really speaks to the diversity of research approaches at OpenAI, and their belief in experimenting with different paths to see what yields the best results. It's almost like an evolution happening in real time, isn't it?",

      "text": "There was also an interesting exchange about the context length of GPT-4o. One user noted that 32k tokens can feel restrictive for long coding or writing tasks, especially when compared to other AI models. Sam Altman agreed and said, 'We're working on it!' It's clear that they understand the demand for broader context capabilities and are putting effort into making these improvements. Perhaps soon, we will see models capable of handling conversations as long as, say, writing an entire book in one sitting.",

His response was confident: 'We believe it is achievable with current hardware.' That is a bold statement, and it reflects OpenAI’s optimism in pushing the boundaries of what's possible today. However, we all know that hardware is just one part of the equation. The real magic lies in optimizing software, models, and ensuring safety during these rapid advancements.",
