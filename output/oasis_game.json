This one is completely generated by artificial intelligence. No traditional game engines, no manual development of each game element. Everything in Oasis, from the world you explore to the rules you interact with, is created in real time by an AI model.",

It’s based on an architecture involving Transformers—yes, those same Transformers that have been making waves in natural language processing and image generation. Specifically, Oasis uses a combination of a spatial autoencoder and a latent diffusion backbone. Think of these as two parts of the brain that let the game understand and generate complex environments and interactions in real time.",

      "text": "The exciting thing here is that Oasis doesn’t just generate static worlds; it’s actually interactive. The game takes in user inputs, like moving, jumping, or picking up items, and generates the gameplay on the fly. The physics, the lighting, even the animals you meet—all of it is generated live. And because there is no game engine, this means there are essentially no predefined limits to what Oasis can create.",

      "text": "The performance, frankly, is nothing short of astonishing. The model runs at 20 frames per second, which is far beyond what other AI-driven video generation models have managed so far. Models like Sora or Mochi-1 can take up to 10-20 seconds just to generate a single second of video. Imagine trying to play a game like that! But Oasis, thanks to some impressive optimization using Decart’s inference engine, runs smoothly—enabling players to actually interact with the environment in real time, just as you would in a regular video game.",

They’re working towards even higher performance by optimizing the model for specialized hardware—specifically, Etched's Transformer ASIC called Sohu. They believe that with this new hardware, Oasis could scale to massive models in 4K resolution, and that’s something that could redefine not only gaming but also how we think about creating any kind of interactive media.",

For example, distant objects might appear fuzzy, or it may have difficulty with precise inventory control. These are typical growing pains for any AI model, and the Oasis team is confident they can solve these issues through larger datasets and better model scaling.",

Instead of a game being meticulously designed by a team of developers over years, what if it could just be described and then brought to life by an AI? This opens up opportunities for anyone with an idea to create their own world, their own story—without needing a big studio or budget.",
