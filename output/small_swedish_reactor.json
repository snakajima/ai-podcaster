Deep Atomic, a Swiss nuclear energy startup, has developed a small modular reactor called the MK60, designed to tackle the increasing energy demands of data centers. Data centers, as you know, are the backbone of our digital world, supporting everything from AI applications to cloud storage. But they require a massive amount of energy, which often becomes a major bottleneck for growth and sustainability.",

      "text": "Deep Atomic's solution to this problem is their 60 MW small modular reactor, or SMR. This reactor provides 60 megawatts of electricity along with 60 megawatts of cooling power—two things data centers desperately need. The reactor is designed to be installed on-site at these data centers, delivering reliable, zero-carbon power while also significantly reducing cooling costs and environmental impact. Think about that: one small nuclear reactor, specifically designed to sit right where the data is being processed. It can make our digital infrastructure more efficient, greener, and more scalable.",

      "text": "Freddy Mondale, the head of engineering at Deep Atomic, calls the 60 MW capacity a 'sweet spot' for data centers. It’s large enough to handle significant computational infrastructure, yet small enough to allow for modular deployment and scaling. This smaller scale not only makes deployment easier but also reduces the initial capital costs compared to larger reactors, while offering the flexibility to expand by adding more units as energy demands grow.",

Google recently signed its first contract to purchase electricity from small modular reactors, and Microsoft is set to reopen a former US nuclear plant to meet its own growing energy needs. Clearly, there's a trend here. The energy demands of AI, cloud computing, and even cryptocurrency are pushing us to innovate and rethink how we generate power.",

They aren’t reinventing nuclear technology; rather, they're refining existing, proven tech for practical use in the data center industry. Rea Stark, Co-founder and Chief Design Officer at Deep Atomic, pointed out that this strategy allows for smoother regulatory processes and efficient scaling, which are essential for wide adoption.",
