Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, which might have missed the whisper number of $0.65 but still beat the analysts' expectations of $0.58. Revenue came in at $25.18 billion, slightly below Wall Street's estimate of $25.4 billion. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but there’s a lot more beneath the surface that points to exciting trends and opportunities.",

It's already the third best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., right behind Tesla's own Model Y and Model 3. The Cybertruck, with its unique design and robust capabilities, has carved out a niche in a market that’s slowly getting crowded. It's fascinating to see how Tesla's bold choices in design and technology are being rewarded by consumer interest and market performance.",

During their recent 'We, Robot' event, they showcased their long-term vision for autonomous transport, and we’re already seeing some impressive milestones. Over two billion miles have been driven cumulatively on Full Self-Driving, with more than 50% on version 12—a clear indicator that their software is becoming more capable, and the Tesla fleet is gathering valuable data.",

These vehicles are expected to bring Tesla’s vision of electric, autonomous transport to a wider audience. The idea is that autonomous technology will make owning and operating a car cheaper than even rideshare or public transport. And while some of these statements sound ambitious, Tesla has a track record of turning vision into reality, albeit sometimes on a longer timeline.",

      "text": "One of the most interesting parts of the earnings call was the progress on Tesla's energy products. The Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments hit a new record. Tesla’s energy division is often overshadowed by the car business, but it’s a crucial part of their mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Seeing this growth and hearing about their strong gross margins in the energy sector is exciting.",

He talked about the Optimus robot and how they’re making strides in tactile sensing and production capabilities. He even went as far as to say that Optimus could become the most valuable product Tesla ever makes. Imagine a future where humanoid robots help us with day-to-day tasks—this is the kind of stuff that was once science fiction, and now Tesla is trying to bring it to life.",

He even hinted that their internal cell production—the 4680 battery—could soon become the most competitive battery cell in North America, which would be a big win for Tesla's production efficiency and cost control.",
