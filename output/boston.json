Imagine a future where robots don’t just automate factory floors, but can also perform sophisticated tasks, adapt to new environments, and perhaps even become our companions. Well, that future might be closer than you think.",

Now, imagine that combined with Toyota's cutting-edge AI models, what they call Large Behavior Models or LBMs. Together, these technologies could help bring us humanoid robots that are not just physically capable, but also intelligent enough to adapt and learn new skills rapidly.",

They allow robots to not only respond to commands, but to understand context, learn from their environment, and perform tasks they've never explicitly been programmed for. It’s all about creating the kind of flexible, adaptive intelligence that makes robots far more useful in unpredictable settings.",

      "text": "One of the biggest challenges in robotics is the gap between hardware and software. Atlas, for instance, is amazing in terms of its hardware capabilities—its mobility, its strength, and its dexterity are unmatched. But what has been lacking in most humanoid robots is the ability to use all of those capabilities effectively in unstructured, real-world environments. This is where TRI’s AI comes in. By utilizing Large Behavior Models, we can give Atlas the ability to understand what’s around it, make decisions, and adapt, which is key to creating robots that are genuinely useful beyond the lab.",

      "text": "Take the example of manipulating objects. TRI has been working on AI models for dexterous manipulation—this means not just picking up an object, but understanding how to handle it depending on its shape, weight, and even fragility. TRI’s diffusion policy approach, which uses generative AI, has made it possible for robots to handle complex objects with more human-like skill. When you combine that with Atlas's physical capabilities, the potential applications are mind-blowing.",

Think about search and rescue, where you need robots to navigate through rubble or uneven terrain, or even helping in homes for elderly care, providing assistance with daily activities. The idea here is to make robots general-purpose enough to learn tasks on the go, based on what they observe and experience. It’s a future where robots aren't just tools, but partners that amplify what humans can do.",
