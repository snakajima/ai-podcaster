      "text": "Today, we're talking about an exciting trend in the AI world: a massive decrease in the cost of large language model inference—a trend that Andreessen Horowitz’s Guido Appenzeller is calling 'LLMflation.' This trend points to how rapidly the costs associated with high-quality AI language models are plummeting, making AI more accessible than ever before. Let’s break it down.",

      "text": "First, let's put this in perspective. Just three years ago, in 2021, using a model on the scale of OpenAI’s GPT-3 would set you back around $60 per million tokens. Today, you can get a model with similar capabilities for just $0.06 per million tokens. That's a staggering 1,000-fold drop!",

This isn't just about new GPUs being faster—it’s also about their increased efficiency and how they’re specifically optimized to handle the intense workloads of AI models. This has allowed compute power to be used more effectively, lowering the overall costs.",

Over time, developers have found new ways to streamline AI models, reducing the computing needs and eliminating memory bottlenecks that previously made inference so costly. This is where a lot of subtle improvements in algorithms and data handling come into play, making it possible to run these models with less hardware and time.",
