These included some creative, although not heavily interactive, titles, like the *Headspace Guide to Meditation*, which combined wellness with a personalized meditation experience, and a children’s *Carmen Sandiego* show that let young viewers guide the character’s journey.",

In fact, only 24 interactive titles were ever made, according to Gizmodo. And as we can see from Netflix's recent actions, most of these shows will be delisted from the platform, leaving only a few of the more popular ones, like *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*, *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend*, *Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls*, and *You vs. Wild*.",

      "text": "There are likely several reasons behind Netflix’s decision to move away from interactive content. For one, low popularity could be a factor. Additionally, licensing costs for shows based on external IPs, like *Boss Baby*, are not cheap. In the streaming world, companies have to pay yearly residuals to keep licensed titles, and by cutting these interactive shows, Netflix might be aiming to reduce these costs.",

      "text": "But the story doesn’t end there. Rather than abandoning innovation entirely, Netflix is now looking to generative AI to carve out its niche in gaming. The company has already been experimenting with games available on mobile, but this shift marks a new level of ambition. Netflix's head of gaming, Mike Vertu, has even taken on the title of 'VP of GenAI for Games.' He recently expressed his enthusiasm about this pivot on LinkedIn, saying he hasn’t felt this excited since the '90s, when new game releases brought groundbreaking experiences every few months.",

      "text": "The idea of generative AI in gaming is captivating. Netflix seems to be inspired by platforms like Roblox, where users can already generate 3D objects and scenes with simple AI prompts. Imagine a Netflix gaming experience where users can craft entire game worlds through a few commands or customize gameplay elements on the fly. It’s a new frontier that could attract creative and gaming audiences alike.",

      "text": "That said, this approach raises some questions. Can AI-generated games compete with traditional games crafted by skilled artists and writers? Creative vision still plays a huge role in gaming, and while AI can assist in generating assets or setting up environments, a game still needs that 'spark'—a story, a compelling experience that keeps people engaged. Will Netflix’s GenAI for games deliver that spark? Only time will tell.",

It’s clear Netflix views the gaming space—and perhaps even social media—as competitors for audience attention. Co-founder Reed Hastings has commented before that gaming and social platforms are Netflix’s biggest competition. This move aligns with that perspective, aiming to capture engagement on multiple fronts.",
