That was the dream behind OpenAI when it was founded as a nonprofit. But, fast forward to today, OpenAI has for-profit subsidiaries, investors, and a valuation that's exploded to a whopping $157 billion. It's clear that things have evolved quite a bit since the beginning.",

This meant not being beholden to shareholders or profit motives but instead being focused solely on advancing technology in a way that was safe and equitable. But as the organization grew, it needed funding—massive amounts of funding—to keep up with the rapid pace of AI research.",

      "text": "To do that, OpenAI set up a for-profit arm, which allowed it to attract investors and commercialize its technology. This structure, called a 'capped-profit' model, was supposed to balance the nonprofit's mission with the need to generate revenue. But now, with a valuation in the billions, some experts are questioning whether the nonprofit is still in control—or whether the financial interests have taken over.",

If the nonprofit loses control of its for-profit subsidiaries, it may have to pay for the assets that originally belonged to the charitable entity. It's a complex situation, with regulators like the IRS and attorneys general in Delaware and California likely to scrutinize any changes closely.",

But as we've seen, the organization’s focus has shifted, and some critics—like Elon Musk and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton—believe that the pursuit of profits has started to overshadow the original emphasis on safety and the greater good.",
