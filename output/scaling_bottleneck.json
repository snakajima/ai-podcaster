This improvement is largely attributed to an increase in the computational power used to train these models. Think of it like this—if LLMs were musicians, their growing virtuosity comes from being given more practice time, more refined instruments, and more skilled bandmates to play alongside.",

You may have heard of Moore's law, which essentially says computing power tends to double every two years. Well, the growth we're seeing in the training power for these models is actually outpacing Moore's law, but at a cost. And that's where the bottlenecks come in.",

      "text": "One of the simplest ways to think about scaling a model is to extend how long you train it. The longer the training runs, the better the model can become. But in practice, training runs rarely exceed six months. Why? The hardware and software used can become obsolete in that timeframe, meaning a model trained too long could already be outdated by the time it’s ready. Imagine running a marathon only to find out the finish line no longer exists—it’s been moved somewhere else!",

      "text": "This leaves us with another way to scale: make the training clusters bigger. Essentially, add more GPUs. It sounds straightforward enough, right? Well, not quite. As we add more GPUs, we start hitting a bottleneck known as 'data movement.' More GPUs mean more data that needs to be moved around—both within each GPU and between different GPUs. And that data movement starts to slow everything down. It’s like a large orchestra—if too many musicians need to pass a note to each other in real time, chaos can ensue, and efficiency plummets.",

They refer to something called the 'latency wall'—a term that describes the limits on how quickly GPUs in a cluster can communicate with each other. If the latency between them becomes too high, it doesn’t matter how many GPUs you have, you just can’t train the model effectively anymore. Think of it as an information traffic jam—no matter how wide the road is, if the cars have to stop too frequently, they can never make it to their destination in good time.",

Within each GPU, data has to move between its cores and memory—a kind of internal flow, called intra-GPU data movement. This movement has its own constraints, mostly because the GPU memory bandwidth isn’t unlimited, meaning there’s a limit to how fast the data can be moved for computation.",

This is where the challenges of different parallelism methods come into play: data parallelism, pipeline parallelism, tensor parallelism, and expert parallelism. Each of these requires unique communication strategies between GPUs. Imagine multiple chefs in a large kitchen trying to cook a complex dish together—some focus on chopping, some on cooking, and some on plating. Each chef needs to share information about what they’re doing to keep the entire process running smoothly.",

Pipeline parallelism is more like a relay race, with GPUs handing off their output to each other in sequence. Tensor parallelism, on the other hand, divides the heavy math of model computations among GPUs. And finally, expert parallelism allocates specific 'experts' to GPUs, meaning different parts of the model are run separately, and then all the results are merged together.",

According to the researchers, one of the more promising avenues is hardware improvement—faster interconnects and better memory bandwidth. But another option is to change the way we approach training itself. Instead of trying to scale linearly and keep adding GPUs, we might need to change the way we think about batch sizes or even reduce model depth while keeping other aspects of the architecture scalable.",

And that means, to keep advancing, we will need either novel breakthroughs in hardware or entirely new ways of training these models.",
