Imagine trying to put together an incredibly intricate puzzle, one where each piece is not only delicate but also needs to connect perfectly to achieve optimal performance. CoWoS is an advanced packaging technology that allows multiple components, or chiplets, to be assembled into a single package, and it plays a huge role in allowing us to keep up with the increasing demands for computing power.",

      "text": "In traditional chip design, we had these monolithic chips where everything—CPU, GPU, memory—was integrated into one die. But as the complexity of modern computing has increased, these designs faced challenges like power limits, heat dissipation issues, and manufacturing limitations. That's where chiplets and packaging technologies like CoWoS come in. They allow us to split components into specialized chiplets and bring them together in a way that ensures they work seamlessly, almost as if they were part of the same die.",

      "text": "So why do we need CoWoS? For one, it's all about performance. AI training, data analytics, and high-performance computing demand incredible memory bandwidth and efficient communication between different parts of the processor. CoWoS allows us to bring memory and processing components close together, which reduces latency and increases bandwidth—essentially supercharging performance. Without this, the pace of advancements in AI and computing would likely slow down.",

      "text": "But here's the catch—CoWoS is not easy. The process of connecting multiple chiplets is extremely complicated. With CoWoS, you place these chiplets on a silicon interposer, which is a layer that acts as a bridge between the chips and the substrate below. Think of it like laying down a network of high-speed rail tracks that ensure data moves smoothly between different components.",

      "text": "Recently, Nvidia has been pushing the boundaries by moving from the more common version, called CoWoS-S, to CoWoS-L. The 'L' version uses an organic interposer instead of a silicon one, allowing for larger and more complex packages. This is crucial for scaling to the sizes required for next-gen GPUs, but it introduces significant challenges. Unlike silicon, organic materials have different properties, like how they expand and contract with heat, which can lead to issues with warping and reliability.",

Reports indicate that Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, which were supposed to use CoWoS-L, are delayed due to problems with this new packaging technology. Specifically, there have been issues with thermal expansion mismatches between the chiplets, the bridges, and the organic interposer itself, causing warping that can break connections. And that's not all—there's also a shortage of CoWoS packaging capacity at TSMC, Nvidia's manufacturing partner.",

It's a reminder of just how fragile the supply chain for cutting-edge technology really is. Even if we solve the problem in design, there's the challenge of manufacturing at scale, and that's exactly what we're seeing play out with Nvidia right now.",

To keep up with the demand, they are reportedly working on a modified version of the Blackwell GPU, called the B200A, which will use the older CoWoS-S technology instead. This means they can keep producing chips while working through the challenges of CoWoS-L. It's a clever workaround, but it highlights the balancing act that companies need to perform—between innovation and the need to deliver products to customers.",

The ability to integrate multiple components with the performance levels needed for AI is one of the major factors that has allowed us to make progress in recent years. But, like with any cutting-edge tech, challenges arise—sometimes from the physics of materials themselves, sometimes from the production capacity limits.",
